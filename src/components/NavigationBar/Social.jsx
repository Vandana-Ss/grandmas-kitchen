                <h3 className="italic font-extralight">Love, nourishment, tradition, and giving back</h3>

                <p>At Grandma’s Kitchen Recipes, we believe that food is not just
                    for the table—it’s for the soul. Inspired by the warmth and
                    care of our grandmothers, we are committed to spreading that
                    same love to our community.
